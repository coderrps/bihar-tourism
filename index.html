        <h1>Magnificent Bihar</h1>
        <p class="about">Bihar's antiquity is evident from its name, which is derived from the ancient word "VIHARA"
            (monastery). It
            is indeed a land of monasteries. Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Muslim and Sikh shrines abound in this ancient land
            where India's first major empires rose and fell. Where the ruins of the worlds' earliest university slumbers
            in the void of time. The passage of Ganga, flowing wide and deep enrich the plains of Bihar before
            distributing in Bengal's deltoid zone.
            Among all Indian states, Bihar is the one most intimately linked to the Buddha's life, resulting in a trail
            of pilgrimages which have come to be known as the Buddhist circuit. The Buddhist trail begins at the capital
            city, Patna, where a noteworthy museum contains a collection of Hindu and Buddhist sculptures as well as a
            terracotta urn said to contain the ashes of Lord Buddha.</p>

                        <p>One of the very unique experience I have ever had exploring Indian caves of pre christ era.
                            This one was way different because the way it was carved out 1000s years before and you will
                            be shocked to touch and feel the inner linings of the caves. It was magnificently smooth.
                            Truly amazing</p>

                        <p>A must place to visit, there are 3 way to reach top. One from Bela side. Only stairs are
                            there so it's little tough because of height of stairs. one from makhdumpur side. 3 to 4
                            km trekking but easy to reach on top. There are so many caves, but for cave you need to
                            go from Bela side.</p>
